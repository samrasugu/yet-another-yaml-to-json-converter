## YET ANOTHER YAML TO JSON CONVERTER

A simple script that automates converting yaml files to json equivalents.

Called in YAYTOJC which sounds lame but call it what you like.ðŸ˜‰

## How to run

- Clone the repo
- Within the project directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - This will install `pyyaml` which is used to manipulate yaml files in Python
- Run `python script.py`
    - This command will generate a database.json file in the current project directory
